# Coordinates of a Point

Write an algorithm that reads two floating values (x and y), which should represent the coordinates of a point in a plane.  Next, determine which quadrant the point belongs, or if you are at one  of the Cartesian axes or the origin (x = y = 0).

If the point is at the origin (0,0), write the message "Origin".

If the point is at X axis write "X Axis", else if the point is at Y axis write "Y Axis".

## Input

The input contains the coordinates of a point.

## Output

The output should display the quadrant in which the point is.
