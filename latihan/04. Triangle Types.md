# Triangle Types

Read 3 double numbers (A, B and C) representing the sides of a triangle  and arrange them in decreasing order, so that the side A is the biggest  of the three sides. Next, determine the type of triangle that they can  make, based on the following cases always writing an appropriate  message:

1. f A â‰¥ B + C, write the message: NO TRIANGLE SHAPE
2. if A^2 = B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGLE RECTANGLE
3. if A^2 > B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGLE OBTUANGLE
4. if A^2 < B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGLE ACUTANGLE
5. if the three sides are the same size, write the message: EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE
6. if only two sides are the same and the third one is different, write the message: ISOSCELES TRIANGLE

## Input

The input contains three double numbers, A (0 < A) , B (0 < B) and C (0 < C).

## Output

Print all the classifications of the triangle presented in the input.
